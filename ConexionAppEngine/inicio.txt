 I'm starting from scratch
Set up your local directory

Set up Git on your machine if you haven't already.

mkdir /path/to/your/projectcd /path/to/your/projectgit initgit remote add origin https://gonzalo986@bitbucket.org/gonzalo986/fleteweb.git

Create your first file, commit, and push

echo "gonzalo986" >> contributors.txtgit add contributors.txtgit commit -m 'Initial commit with contributors'git push -u origin master

Great job, now you're all set up! Get started coding or create a team and invite people to work with you.
I have an existing project

Already have a Git repository on your computer? Let's push it up to Bitbucket.

cd /path/to/my/repogit remote add origin https://gonzalo986@bitbucket.org/gonzalo986/fleteweb.gitgit push -u origin --all # pushes up the repo and its refs for the first timegit push -u origin --tags # pushes up any tags
